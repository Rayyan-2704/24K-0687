* For "5>8" : 5 is not greater than 8, hence the false statement runs, which is after colon.
* For "1 != 2 < 5" : The comparison (less than) sign has a higher superiority than the not equals to sign, so 2 < 5 is true and will give the value of 1. However,
  1 != 1 is false as 1 IS equals to 1, hence the false statement runs and 30 is stored in the variable 'x'.
